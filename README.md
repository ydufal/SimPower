# SimPower
One of my Java Projects


The objective of this topic was to simulate in a playful way the electricity supply of a game area. The player's objective is to supply all the population located in the game area while minimising the cost of energy for the inhabitants as well as the pollution (and possibly the nuisances/accidents).

We have therefore defined a randomly generated game zone.  This game board contains different zones that can be exploited to produce electricity (wind, water, sun, minerals...)

If you want to know a little bit more about the project feel free to ask, I could send you the application for you to play.

ps : For information we used Gradle for this project
